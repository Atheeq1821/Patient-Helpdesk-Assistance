Although it has a new-age maternity benefit, and an updated bonus feature, it also has its fair share of restrictions including limiting you to a single private room during hospitalization, a waiting period for pre-existing diseases that spans up to 4 years, and a maternity benefit that also comes with waiting periods of upto 4 years. We wouldn't recommend buying this plan unless you're really looking for a budget option.",
